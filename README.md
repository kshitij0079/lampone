Exciting Announcement!

I am pleased to announce that I am currently engaged in an ambitious open-source project. This endeavor aims to combine the charm of retro handheld gaming with the functionality of a mini computer and a smart TV stick.

Introducing a retro handheld device that allows users to enjoy their favorite NES, GBC, GBA, NDS, and PS1 games. Furthermore, this device operates as a mini computer running Raspbian and a smart TV stick, leveraging the Banana Pi M2 Zero or a RasberryPi single board computer.

Imagine the convenience of carrying a portable device that provides access to classic games, web browsing, coding capabilities, and the ability to transform any HDMI-equipped TV into an Android-based smart TV.

By harnessing the advanced capabilities of the Banana Pi M2 Zero, we are developing a versatile platform that seamlessly integrates retro gaming, mini computing, and smart TV functionalities, all within a single compact package.

Our team is dedicated to creating an accessible and user-friendly project that will empower enthusiasts and developers to explore the countless possibilities offered by this multifunctional device.

Stay tuned for updates as we make substantial progress toward bringing this open-source project to fruition. Let us join forces to unlock the ultimate retro gaming and computing experience!
